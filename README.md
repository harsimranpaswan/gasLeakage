# Gas Leakage Detection System - Project Highlights

- **Gas Leakage Detection System**: Designed and implemented a real-time gas leakage detection system using sensors, alert mechanisms, and cloud-based monitoring.
- **Multi-Channel Alerting**: Integrated an alarm system, email notifications, and automated phone calls to ensure timely awareness in case of gas leaks.
- **Cloud Data Logging**: Deployed sensor readings to the cloud for continuous monitoring and future analysis, enhancing predictive maintenance capabilities.
- **Emergency Response System**: Developed a comprehensive notification framework to alert users even if they are away from the affected area.
- **Data Analytics for Risk Prediction**: Implemented data analysis techniques to predict potential hazards based on historical sensor data trends.
